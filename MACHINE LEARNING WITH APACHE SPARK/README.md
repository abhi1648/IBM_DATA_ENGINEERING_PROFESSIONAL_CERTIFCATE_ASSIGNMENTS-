# IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate Final Project
## Build an ML Pipeline for Airfoil Noise Prediction

### Project Overview
As a data engineer at an aeronautics consulting company, your role is crucial in facilitating the work of data scientists who focus on machine learning algorithms. This project utilizes a modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset. The objective is to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks, build a machine learning pipeline for sound level prediction, evaluate the model, and finally, persist the model for future use.

### Objectives
1. **ETL Activity (Part 1):**
   - Load a CSV dataset
   - Remove duplicate rows
   - Drop rows with null values
   - Perform transformations
   - Store the cleaned data in Parquet format

2. **Machine Learning Pipeline (Part 2):**
   - Load the cleaned data
   - Convert string columns to numeric types
   - Create a machine learning pipeline with VectorAssembler, StandardScaler, and LinearRegression stages
   - Split the data into training and testing sets
   - Fit the pipeline with the training data

3. **Evaluate the Model (Part 3):**
   - Predict using the model
   - Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2)

4. **Persist the Model (Part 4):**
   - Save the model to the path "Final_Project"
   - Load the model from the path "Final_Project"
   - Make predictions using the loaded model
   - Display the predictions
